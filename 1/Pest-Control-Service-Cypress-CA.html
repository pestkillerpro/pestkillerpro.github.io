<p>Do not keep too many plants or haphazard packages of papers as dampness and cellulose attract termites. I have actually been working with Animal & Bug Pest Management for many years; I say "with" since it has actually been a real partnership in servicing the needs of the neighborhoods I manage. The chemical insecticides are utilized in a way that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>
