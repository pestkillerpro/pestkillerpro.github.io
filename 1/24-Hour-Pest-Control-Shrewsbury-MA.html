<p>Not sure how to get rid of cockroaches? Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household pest pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about reducing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Do not keep a lot of plants or haphazard bundles of papers as dampness and cellulose draw in termites. I have actually been working with Animal & Insect Pest Management for many years; I say "with" because it has actually been a true collaboration in servicing the requirements of the communities I handle. The chemical insecticides are utilized in a manner that is least disruptive to biological control.</p>

<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM technique by Swezey et al.
