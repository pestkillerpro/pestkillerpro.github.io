<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is usually used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

Companies frequently provide pest controller training programs covering pesticide application and essential elements of the job like handling termites and rodents.</p>
