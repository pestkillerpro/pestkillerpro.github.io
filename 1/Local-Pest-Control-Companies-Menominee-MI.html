<p>If you end up employing a pest-control service, search-- there are big differences in quality, and you do not need to pay more for good service. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic approach towards pest threat management by utilising proactive control methods.

The company takes emergency situations seriously, so if you have a hazardous situation, such as a nest of wasps or a scorpion holding you hostage in your restroom, Orkin will do its best to offer same-day service.

While pheromones are nothing new to pest control-- pest control professionals regularly utilize pheromones traps as a means to keep track of pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
