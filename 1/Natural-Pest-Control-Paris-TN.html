<p>A typical mistake most organisations encounter is explaining their business name too literally by utilizing worn-out pest control terms like control, management, insecticide, and pesticide. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
