<p>This approach refers to the use of a range of physical or mechanical strategies for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

When you work with a pest control company, you are complimentary to invest that time doing other important things. In the last couple of years, pest control has actually become more technically included, with licencing and restrictions on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi states.</p>
