This approach describes making use of a range of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in some cases comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you desire your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. When action, recognition, and monitoring thresholds suggest that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer effective or readily available, IPM programs then examine the proper control method both for effectiveness and threat.

<p>Biological pest control procedures make the most of the hierarchy within nature.
