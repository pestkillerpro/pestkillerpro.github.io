The company takes emergencies seriously, so if you have a hazardous situation, such as a nest of wasps or a scorpion holding you hostage in your restroom, Orkin will do its best to provide same-day service. Considering that the early potatoes are the only food source readily available, the beetles will congregate on these plants where they can more easily be managed.</p>
