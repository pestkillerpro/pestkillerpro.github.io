<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. As soon as action, tracking, and recognition thresholds indicate that pest control is needed, and preventive techniques are no longer effective or readily available, IPM programs then examine the appropriate control approach both for efficiency and danger. The letter of invitation for this plenary address suggested for its title the central style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Truth".</p>
<p>Appropriate scouting also provides data that help to measure the development of pests and natural opponents. In time, with the glue-board tracking program and pest submissions, the committee will end up being familiar with the kinds of pests come across in the structure and the dynamics of the populations. As new pest control methods are found, the producer and crop consultant should adjust their pest control program to show these changes.</p>
<p>The merging of the concepts of integrated control and pest management, and the supreme synthesis into integrated pest management, opened a brand-new age in the protection of agricultural crops, domestic animals, stored products, public health, and the structure of human dwellings versus the attack of arthropod pests, plant and animal diseases, and weeds.</p>

Biopesticides are normally compatible with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>
