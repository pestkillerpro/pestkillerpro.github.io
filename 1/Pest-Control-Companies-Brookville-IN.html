<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your center presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
