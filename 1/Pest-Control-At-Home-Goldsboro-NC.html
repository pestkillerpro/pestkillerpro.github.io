If all other integrated pest management methods are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Contact the U.S. EPA and your state pesticide regulatory agency with any concerns about the approval status of dicamba herbicide items for in-crop usage with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend Â® soybeans or products with XtendFlex Â® Technology. While moving into a new house or house, invest and get an expert assessment into a preventive termite control service, like that of HiCare.</p>
