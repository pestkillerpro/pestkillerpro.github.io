Pest control has to do with non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area clean and free of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of a door and the flooring. </p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack away from the crop. Managing pests can be done in lots of ways but a reliable method is to clear out the bugs regularly.
