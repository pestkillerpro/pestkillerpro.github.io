<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich area likely will have a great deal of large, costly homes, so pest control costs might be higher there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those homes. </p>
