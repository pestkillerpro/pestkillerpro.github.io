<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be extremely reliable in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in particular scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

Our online courses consist of Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, as well as the first-ever web-based hygienic and phytosanitary steps curriculum (sponsored by USAID).
