<p>Since the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical industry to suggest essentially anything a professional desires it to imply, Beyond Pesticides has actually welcomed the expression Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus specialists need to have -emphasizing the wider ecology of pest management and preventing hazardous chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
