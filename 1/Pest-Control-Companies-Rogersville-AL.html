<p>The most reliable technique for controlling pests is to integrate techniques in a method known as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). A normal mistake most services run into is describing their business name too literally by using tired pest control terms like control, pesticide, insecticide, and management. The pest management market is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>Termites are such destructive pests that you desire your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. As soon as monitoring, action, and identification thresholds show that pest control is required, and preventive approaches are no longer reliable or readily available, IPM programs then examine the appropriate control technique both for effectiveness and danger. The letter of invitation for this plenary address recommended for its title the central style of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: An International Reality".</p>
