Biological pathogens: Bacillus thuringiensis, also called Bt, is a soil-borne germs that combats mosquitoes and insects in the larval, caterpillar stage.</p>
<p>Likewise, think about how the variety of plants to be grown in the very same location may influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control has to do with non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area tidy and free of any food particles or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the area in between the bottom of the flooring and a door. </p>
