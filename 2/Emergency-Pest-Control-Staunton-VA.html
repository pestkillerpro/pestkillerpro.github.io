<p>The variety of plants inspected will depend on factors such as the value of the crop, possible problems and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to traditional synthetic pesticides-- in a practical, long-term plan. Biopesticides are usually suitable with natural opponents, however there are exceptions.</p>
