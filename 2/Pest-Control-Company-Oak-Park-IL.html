<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded advancement and feeding and go through higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). To put it simply, an efficient, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, thereby reinforcing the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.</p>
