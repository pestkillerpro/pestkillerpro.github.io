<p>The goal of innovation need to be to protect and where possible boost production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal usage of synthetic fertilizer and chemical pesticides. Paperwork would be hard to get even if concerted efforts were made due to the several prospective causes for long-lasting and short symptoms and diseases connected with direct exposure to pests and pesticides.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed local farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).

<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are brought in to a number of locations that can supply any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3. If much of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be used as the last hope, in principle, sometimes they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of particular endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to safeguard the seed and transplants from typical and relentless pest problems.</p>
<p>Preventing specimens from being assaulted and harmed by pests is a significant challenge of collection management. Some need long-term agreements that cost $400 or more although for the majority of pests, a single treatment done well need to be sufficient. As soon as the committee understands the types of pests that may enter the building and potentially damage collection materials, the next step is to establish an IPPM program to resolve the determined needs. </p>
