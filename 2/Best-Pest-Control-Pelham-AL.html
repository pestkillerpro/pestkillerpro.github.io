<p>Think about alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a structure. Recent quests for efficient, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily towards development of brand-new and much better items with which to change conventional toxic pesticides.</p>

<p>A biological control program can succeed if these recommendations are followed: 1) correctly determine all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural enemies from a reputable biological control supplier, 3) make sure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) highlight that proper shipping treatments be followed, and 5) acquire directions from biological control providers on correct release rates and timing of application.</p>
