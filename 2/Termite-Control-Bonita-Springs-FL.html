<p>This approach describes the use of a variety of physical or mechanical techniques for pest exclusion, trapping (in many cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove because growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact product or services.</p>
