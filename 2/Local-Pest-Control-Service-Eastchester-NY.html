The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
<p>Due to its significance, the European Union has actually adopted IPM as a policy for management of insects and other pests.
