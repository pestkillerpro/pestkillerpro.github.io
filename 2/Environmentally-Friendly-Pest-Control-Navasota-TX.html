<p>There is no clear clinical evidence that taking in crop items stemmed from genetically crafted plants has actually triggered destructive effects to human beings or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has actually been for some time, produced with genetically crafted bacteria).
