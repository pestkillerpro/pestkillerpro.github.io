<h3>Insect Control Service Rainbow City Alabama</h2>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies.

<p>The determination of the appropriate cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides toxic to most insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life phases.</p>

Modern crop ranges typically accidentally produce conditions which favor pest types (e.g., pest species which have actually bored deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural enemies).
