Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>In the past, discussions of Integrated Pest Management for archives and libraries have often concentrated on the disinfestation of known pest issues in collections. I have actually currently jotted down the tentative rates for numerous pest control services in Chandigarh below. Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is commonly understood, is a system of managing pests which is developed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Integrate row covers with crop rotation if you're handling pests that overwinter in the soil.
