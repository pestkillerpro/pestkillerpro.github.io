<p>Objective Statement: The objective of Mosquito Control is to provide Leon County homeowners with ecologically sound and effective mosquito control services. Just like us, pests require shelter, water, and food to survive, and if they can't discover these in your house, it's most likely they'll go somewhere else.

<h3>Fire Ant Facts and Pest Control Willimantic CT</h3>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are utilized only when needed and in mix with other approaches for more efficient, long-lasting control.
