<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. But home pests can also be a threat to your household. When looking for a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of large, expensive homes, so pest control costs could be greater there due to the fact that there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses. </p>
