<p>To get more corn per acre, having a strong understanding of the level of pressure and type of pests is essential for selecting the best corn traits and agronomic practices to address these difficulties. Even with all the understanding about the pest and accessibility of resources for its efficient management, losses can be avoided only when corrective actions are taken at the right time.</p>
<p>Pest control is an incredibly important measure owing to the reality that a variety of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing new to pest control-- pest control professionals frequently use pheromones traps as a means to monitor pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new idea. </p>
