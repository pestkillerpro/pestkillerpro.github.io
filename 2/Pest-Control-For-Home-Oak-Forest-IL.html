Biological insecticides, stemmed from naturally occurring microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungi and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this classification.</p>
<p>There are things you can do immediately prior to your pest control expert arrives on the scene.

<p>We historically have sold nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the efficiency of ecologically unsound approaches as well as its array of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, stress of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
