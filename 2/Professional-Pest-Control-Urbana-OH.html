Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus specialists need to have -highlighting the broader ecology of pest management and avoiding toxic chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan.
