Possibly biological control is most known for importation of natural opponents, often from the pest's location of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were assaulting California citrus orchards).</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove because growers were not prepared for such an intercropping plan. If your facility currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
