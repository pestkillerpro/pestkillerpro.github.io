The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and approximately 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are typically found pests in our society.</p>
<p>So, pest control must be carried out at the time you have even observed the sign of pest infestation at your premise. Do safely and correctly use pesticides.
