Pest Control Professionals (PCPs) like the ones at Modern Pest use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and understand that the secret to suppressing pests long-term is prevention and management.

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded advancement and feeding and are subject to higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, a reliable, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak might be to retard its development and damage while offering the parasitoids time to work, thus strengthening the parasitoids' impact throughout subsequent generations.</p>
