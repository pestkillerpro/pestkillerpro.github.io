<p>Consider alternative approaches (other than pesticides) to make your house and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Recent quests for effective, safe, and lasting pest management programs have actually been targeted primarily toward development of brand-new and much better products with which to replace conventional toxic pesticides.</p>
<p>Damage of crop residue: Pupae of bug remains inside the crop residue and can be controlled by destroying it. IPM is practiced to some degree in all agricultural crops, but artificial pesticides remain a dominant tactic in managing pests. Maybe you're the type to dive in, research your pest, check out the most efficient control options, and are feeling well prepared to take things on by yourself.</p>
<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>Pest control is an extremely crucial measure owing to the reality that a number of pests are providers of hazardous disease-causing microbes. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the eradication of a couple of pests by collective efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While pheromones are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control specialists frequently use scents traps as a method to monitor pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a brand-new idea. </p>
<p>Using details about pests' biology and routines, along with an arsenal of pest management techniques, pest control employees locate, identify, and get rid of pests.

A regular tracking program is the basis of IPM choice making, no matter the control techniques utilized.</p>
